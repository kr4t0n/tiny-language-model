Tim and Jen did not like that. They did not want another snowman. They wanted Bob. They did not want a picture. They wanted Bob. They cried and hugged Bob.
But Mom was right. The next day, the sun came out. It was warm and bright. Bob started to melt. His hat fell off. His scarf slipped. His carrot nose dropped. His chubby body got smaller and smaller.

Sam looked at the fish and said, "Wow, you have a lot of fish! The big one is very big, the medium one is very medium, and the tiny one is very tiny. You are a good fisherman!"
The fisherman smiled and said, "Thank you, little boy. You are very kind. But I am not a good fisherman. I am a modest fisherman. I don't need a lot of fish. I only need enough for me and my cat. The big one is for me, the medium one is for my cat, and the tiny one is for you."
Sam was surprised and happy. He said, "For me? Really? Thank you, fisherman! You are very generous. But how can I eat the fish? I don't have a fire or a pan."
The fisherman said, "Don't worry, little boy. I have a fire and a pan in my boat. Come with me and I will cook the fish for you. But we have to be quick. The sun is going down and it will be dark soon."

Sam took the plate and the fork. He said, "Thank you, fisherman. You are very nice. I will enjoy my fish. But I have to hurry. My mom is waiting for me at home. She will be worried if I am late."
The fisherman said, "You're welcome, little boy. I understand. You have to go home. But come back tomorrow and we can fish again. Maybe we will catch more fish. Maybe we will catch a bigger fish. Maybe we will catch a fish that can speed in the water."
Sam said, "That sounds fun, fisherman. I will come back tomorrow and we can fish again. Maybe we will catch a fish that can speed in the water. That would be amazing. Goodbye, fisherman. See you tomorrow."
Sam ate his fish and gave the plate and the fork back to the fisherman. He got out of the boat and ran to his mom. He told her about his adventure and his new friend. He showed her his fish bone. He said, "Look, mom. This is my fish. It was delicious. The fisherman gave it to me. He is modest and generous and nice. He has a cat and a fire and a pan. He cooked the fish for me. He invited me to fish with him tomorrow. Maybe we will catch a fish that can speed in the water. Can I go, mom? Please?"
His mom hugged him and said, "Of course, you can go, Sam. I'm happy you had a good time and made a new friend. The fisherman sounds like a wonderful person. But remember to be careful and not go too close to the water. And don't stay too long. The sun goes down fast and it gets dark soon."

They took the toy and went to the kitchen. They looked for something that could make it grow. They tried water, milk, bread, honey, and salt. But nothing worked. The toy stayed small.
"Maybe we should just leave it alone," Mum said. "Maybe it will grow back by itself."
"Or maybe we can buy a new one," Dad said. "A bigger one. A better one."
Tom and Lily felt sad. They liked the orange dinosaur. They didn't want a new one. They wanted the old one.
"Can we keep it?" Lily asked.

Tom and Sam were friends who liked to study. They studied many things, like numbers, letters, animals and colors. They also liked to play with dough. They made shapes and figures with the dough and pretended they were real.
One day, they saw a big house with a big car and a big garden. They wondered who lived there. They asked a lady who was walking by. She said, "That is Mr. Rich. He has a lot of money and things. He is very rich."
Tom and Sam wanted to be rich too. They thought, "Maybe if we study more, we will be rich like Mr. Rich." They decided to study more and more and more. They stopped playing with dough and other toys. They only studied all day and all night.
But they were not happy. They missed playing with dough and having fun. They also missed their other friends who still played and laughed. They felt lonely and bored. They realized that studying was good, but not too much. They needed to balance their time and enjoy their childhood.
They decided to go to Mr. Rich's house and ask him how he became rich. They knocked on his door and waited. Mr. Rich opened the door and looked at them. He said, "Who are you and what do you want?"
Tom and Sam said, "We are Tom and Sam. We are your neighbors. We want to know how you became rich. We want to be rich like you."
Mr. Rich smiled and said, "Come in, come in. I will tell you my story. But first, do you want to play with some dough? I have a lot of dough in my kitchen. I like to play with dough and make things. It makes me happy."
Tom and Sam were surprised and happy. They said, "Yes, we love to play with dough. We used to play with dough a lot, but then we stopped. We thought we had to study more to be rich."
Mr. Rich said, "Studying is important, but so is playing. You need to do both. You need to learn new things, but also have fun and be creative. That is how I became rich. I studied hard, but I also played hard. I used my dough to make inventions and sell them. I also made friends and helped others. That is how I became rich and happy."
Tom and Sam learned a valuable lesson. They thanked Mr. Rich and went back to their homes. They decided to study and play with dough every day. They also invited their other friends to join them. They were not rich in money, but they were rich in happiness.

"A snake?" Tom said, dropping it. "But it's not scary. It's not moving."
"That's because it's dead, Tom. It's rotting. That means it's old and bad and smelly. You don't want to touch it. It can make you sick."
